My little Dictionary App ðŸ“–

I was inspired by my husband who is soon to appear on the TV show Countdown, and decided to start creating a Dictionary App!
I wanted to practise creating a React app from scratch as well as get better with CSS.

Some stretch goals for my Dictionary app include:

- GitHub and LinkedIn icons
- Adding images related to the word searched for
- Lucky Dip word button âœ…
- toggle for day/night mode
- word of the day
- can select words to be put in a faves list
- rhyming words
- childrenâ€™s picture dictionary extenion 

Next project idea: an actual Countdown game!
